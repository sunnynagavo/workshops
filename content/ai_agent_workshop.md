## Part 1: Introduction to AI and Agents üåü

### What is an AI Agent?

An **AI Agent** is a smart computer program that can:
- **Perceive** its environment (like reading text or hearing speech)
- **Think** and make decisions based on what it learns
- **Act** to achieve goals (like answering questions or controlling devices)

Think of it like a helpful digital assistant that can understand you, remember things, and take actions to help you!

### AI Agents in Your Life

You probably interact with AI agents more than you realize! Here are some examples:

üéµ **Smart Speakers**: "Hey Alexa, play my favorite song!"
- *Perceives*: Your voice command
- *Thinks*: What song do they want?
- *Acts*: Plays the music

üéÆ **Gaming Characters**: NPCs (Non-Player Characters) in video games
- *Perceive*: Player actions and game state
- *Think*: What should I do next to make the game fun?
- *Act*: Move, attack, give quests, or provide hints

üõí **Chatbots**: Customer service on websites
- *Perceive*: Customer questions
- *Think*: How can I help solve their problem?
- *Act*: Provide answers or connect them to a human

üì± **Recommendation Systems**: Netflix, Spotify, YouTube
- *Perceive*: What you watch/listen to
- *Think*: What might you like next?
- *Act*: Suggest new content

### Different Types of AI Agents

**Simple Reflex Agents**: Follow basic if-then rules
- "If someone says hello, respond with hello back"

**Goal-Based Agents**: Work toward specific objectives
- "Help the user find the best pizza recipe"

**Learning Agents**: Get smarter over time
- "Remember what users like and improve recommendations"

---

## Part 2: Unplugged Activity - "Be the Agent" üé≠

Let's simulate how an AI agent makes decisions! This activity will help you understand the agent decision-making process before we start coding.

### Activity Setup (15 minutes)

**Materials Needed:**
- Index cards or sticky notes
- Markers/pens
- Timer
- Scenario cards (provided below)

### How to Play:

1. **Form teams** of 3-4 students
2. **Choose roles**:
   - 1 "Human User" (gives input)
   - 1 "Agent Brain" (makes decisions)
   - 1-2 "Agent Actions" (carry out the response)

3. **Get scenario cards** with different situations

### Scenario Cards:

**Scenario 1: Weather Helper**
- User Input: "Should I bring an umbrella today?"
- Agent Goal: Help user prepare for weather
- Available Actions: Check weather, give advice, ask for location
- Decision Points: What information do I need? What's the best advice?

**Scenario 2: Study Buddy**
- User Input: "I have a math test tomorrow and I'm worried!"
- Agent Goal: Help user prepare for test
- Available Actions: Suggest study methods, give encouragement, create practice problems
- Decision Points: What kind of help does the user need most?

**Scenario 3: Entertainment Guide**
- User Input: "I'm bored, what should I do?"
- Agent Goal: Suggest fun activities
- Available Actions: Ask about interests, suggest activities, provide instructions
- Decision Points: What does the user enjoy? What's available to them?

### Playing the Game:

1. **Input Phase**: "Human User" reads their scenario
2. **Processing Phase**: "Agent Brain" thinks out loud about:
   - What information do I have?
   - What is the user really asking for?
   - What actions can I take?
   - What would be most helpful?
3. **Action Phase**: "Agent Actions" carries out the brain's decision
4. **Reflection Phase**: Discuss how well the agent helped

### Debrief Questions:
- What was challenging about being an agent?
- How did you decide what information you needed?
- What made some responses better than others?
- How is this similar to how computer agents might work?

## Part 3: Coding Your AI Agent üíª

Now let's build a real AI agent! We'll create a conversational agent that can chat with users, remember information, and help with different tasks.

### Option A: Python Version üêç

**Prerequisites**: Basic familiarity with Python (variables, functions, if-statements)

**What you'll build**: A text-based conversational agent that can:
- Greet users and remember their names
- Answer questions about different topics
- Play simple word games
- Learn new facts from users

Let's start coding! (See the companion file `ai_agent_workshop_code.py` for the complete code)

### Option B: Scratch Version üß©

**Prerequisites**: Basic familiarity with Scratch (sprites, scripts, variables)

**What you'll build**: A visual conversational agent that can:
- Chat with speech bubbles
- Recognize different types of questions
- Remember user preferences
- Show emotions through costume changes

#### Scratch Setup:

1. Go to [scratch.mit.edu](https://scratch.mit.edu)
2. Create a new project
3. Choose or create a character sprite for your agent
4. Add multiple costumes for different emotions (happy, thinking, surprised)

#### Key Scratch Blocks to Use:

```
When [green flag] clicked
Ask [What's your name?] and wait
Set [name] to (answer)
Say [Hello] join (name) for (2) seconds

When I receive [question]
If <(answer) contains [weather]?> then
   Say [Let me check the weather for you!]
Else
   Say [I'm not sure about that. Can you teach me?]
```

#### Scratch Agent Features:

1. **Greeting System**: Ask for name and remember it
2. **Topic Recognition**: Use "contains" blocks to recognize keywords
3. **Emotion Display**: Change costumes based on conversation
4. **Learning Mode**: Let users teach your agent new responses
