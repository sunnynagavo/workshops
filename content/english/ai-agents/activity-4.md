## Time to Create! 🎨

Now it's your turn to design your very own AI agent! You'll plan everything from what it does to how it makes decisions.

## The AI Agent Design Template

Use this template to design your agent. You can write your answers on paper, in a document, or discuss them with a partner.

### Part 1: The Basics

**1. What is your AI agent's name?**

_Example: "StudyBuddy" or "GameGuide" or "ChoreChecker"_

Your agent's name: ________________________________

**2. What problem does it solve?**

_What does it help with? Be specific!_

Your answer: ________________________________

**3. Who would use it?**

_Students? Families? Gamers? Pet owners?_

Your answer: ________________________________

### Part 2: The Agent's Abilities

**4. What can it PERCEIVE (sense/gather information)?**

List at least 3 things your agent needs to know about:

- ________________________________
- ________________________________
- ________________________________

**Example for a homework helper agent:**
- What subjects you have homework in
- When assignments are due
- How much time you have available
- What time of day it is
- Your energy level

**5. How does it THINK (make decisions)?**

What rules or logic does it use? Try writing it as "IF...THEN" statements:

- IF _____________________ THEN _____________________
- IF _____________________ THEN _____________________
- IF _____________________ THEN _____________________

**Example for a homework helper agent:**
- IF assignment is due tomorrow THEN mark as urgent priority
- IF you're tired AND task is difficult THEN suggest taking a break
- IF you have free time THEN recommend starting homework early

**6. What ACTIONS can it take?**

List at least 3 things your agent can do:

- ________________________________
- ________________________________
- ________________________________

**Example for a homework helper agent:**
- Send reminders about upcoming due dates
- Suggest a study schedule
- Find helpful resources for difficult topics
- Celebrate when you finish assignments

### Part 3: Making It Smart

**7. How does it LEARN and improve?**

How will your agent get better over time?

Your answer: ________________________________

**Example:** Track which subjects take you longest, and allocate more time for those subjects in the future.

**8. What type of agent is it?**

Based on what you've designed, is it:
- A Simple Reflex Agent (follows basic rules)
- A Goal-Based Agent (works toward a goal)
- A Learning Agent (improves over time)

Your answer: ________________________________

## Sample Design: Pet Care AI Agent

Let's look at a complete example to inspire you:

### 🐾 Agent Name: "PetPal"

**Problem It Solves**: Helps pet owners take better care of their pets by tracking needs and sending reminders.

**Who Uses It**: Pet owners (especially new pet owners or busy families)

**What It Perceives:**
- Type of pet and breed
- Last feeding time
- Last walk time (for dogs)
- Last vet visit
- Pet's age
- Current weather (for outdoor activities)
- Owner's location (home or away)

**How It Thinks:**

IF (current time - last feeding time) > 8 hours THEN send feeding reminder

IF pet is a dog AND (current time - last walk time) > 4 hours AND owner is home THEN send walk reminder

IF (current date - last vet visit) > 365 days THEN send vet checkup reminder

IF weather is rainy AND dog needs walk THEN suggest indoor play activities

**Actions It Can Take:**
- Send reminders to owner's phone
- Track feeding/walk/vet schedules
- Suggest activities based on pet's energy level
- Order pet food when supplies are low
- Share tips for pet care
- Celebrate pet milestones (birthdays, adoption anniversaries)

**How It Learns:**
- Learns the pet's unique schedule (some dogs need walks 2x/day, others 4x/day)
- Adapts to owner's routine (knows best times to send reminders)
- Remembers which reminders owner actually acts on
- Adjusts food ordering based on how quickly pet goes through food

**Type**: Learning Agent (it adapts to both the pet's needs and owner's habits)

## Design Challenges

Want to practice more? Try designing agents for these scenarios:

### Challenge 1: Garden Guardian 🌱

Design an AI agent that helps people take care of their garden.

**Think about:**
- What information does it need? (weather, soil moisture, plant types, etc.)
- What should it do? (watering reminders, pest alerts, harvest notifications)
- How could it learn? (track which plants grow best, adjust care schedules)

### Challenge 2: Study Session Optimizer 📚

Design an AI agent that helps students study more effectively.

**Think about:**
- What does it track? (subjects, test dates, study time, grades, focus levels)
- How does it help? (creates study plans, suggests breaks, finds resources)
- How does it improve? (learns which study methods work best for you)

### Challenge 3: Friendly Game Companion 🎮

Design an AI agent that plays video games with you as a teammate.

**Think about:**
- What does it observe? (your playing style, game situation, difficulty level)
- How does it decide? (when to attack, defend, use power-ups, help you)
- How does it adapt? (learns your strategies, adjusts difficulty, complements your weaknesses)

## Share Your Design!

If you're doing this workshop with others, share your AI agent design! Present:
1. Your agent's name
2. What problem it solves
3. Your favorite feature
4. How it makes decisions

Then get feedback:
- What do others like about your design?
- What suggestions do they have?
- Could you combine ideas with other designs?

## Bonus: Next Level Thinking

If you want to go deeper, consider these questions:

**Ethics and Safety:**
- What information is your agent allowed to collect?
- How does it protect privacy?
- What if it makes a wrong decision?
- Could your agent accidentally cause harm? How can you prevent that?

**Technical Considerations:**
- What technology would your agent need? (sensors, cameras, internet, etc.)
- Where would it run? (phone app, computer program, physical robot)
- How fast does it need to make decisions?

**Real-World Feasibility:**
- Does the technology exist to build this today?
- If not, what technology is missing?
- How much would it cost to create?

## What We Learned

In this activity, you:
- ✅ Designed a complete AI agent from scratch
- ✅ Thought through how it perceives, thinks, and acts
- ✅ Considered how it could learn and improve
- ✅ Explored different types of AI agents
- ✅ Practiced creative problem-solving

Congratulations! You now understand the fundamentals of AI agents and how to design them! 🎉
