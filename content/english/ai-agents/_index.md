## Introduction

Welcome to the exciting world of AI agents! Have you ever wondered how your phone's virtual assistant knows what you want, or how video game characters seem to make their own decisions? That's the power of AI agents!

In this workshop, you'll discover what AI agents are, see them in action, and even explore how they work. By the end, you'll understand how these intelligent helpers are changing our world - and you might even get inspired to create your own!

**No prior programming experience needed** - just bring your curiosity!

## What is an AI Agent?

An AI agent is like a **smart helper** that can:
- **Perceive** - Notice what's happening around it (like seeing, hearing, or reading information)
- **Think** - Make decisions based on what it perceives
- **Act** - Do something to accomplish a goal

Think of it like this: When you're hungry (perceive), you decide what to eat (think), and then you make or get food (act). An AI agent works the same way, but it's a computer program!

## Why Are AI Agents Cool?

AI agents are everywhere, helping us in amazing ways:

üéÆ **In Games** - Characters that fight alongside you or compete against you

üè† **At Home** - Virtual assistants like Alexa, Siri, or Google Assistant

üöó **On the Road** - Self-driving cars that can navigate streets

üè• **In Healthcare** - Programs that help doctors diagnose diseases

üéì **In Education** - Tutoring programs that adapt to how you learn

## Real-World Examples You Might Know

### Virtual Assistants
When you say "Hey Siri, what's the weather today?", the AI agent:
- **Perceives**: Hears your voice and understands your question
- **Thinks**: Figures out you want weather information for your location
- **Acts**: Looks up the weather and tells you the answer

### Video Game Characters
In games, non-player characters (NPCs) use AI to:
- Decide where to move
- Choose when to attack or defend
- React to what you do
- Work together as a team

### Recommendation Systems
Ever notice how Netflix suggests shows you might like, or how YouTube recommends videos? Those are AI agents learning about your preferences and trying to help you find content you'll enjoy!

## Types of AI Agents

AI agents come in different types, from simple to super smart:

1. **Simple Reflex Agents** - Follow basic "if-then" rules
   - Example: "If the room is dark, turn on the light"

2. **Goal-Based Agents** - Work toward achieving a specific goal
   - Example: A GPS finding the fastest route home

3. **Learning Agents** - Get smarter over time by learning from experience
   - Example: A spam filter that learns what emails you consider junk
