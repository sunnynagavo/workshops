## Can You Find the AI Agents?

Let's start by identifying AI agents in everyday situations! An AI agent needs to **perceive**, **think**, and **act**. Let's see if you can spot which of these are AI agents.

### Scenario 1: Your Morning Alarm
**Situation**: Your phone alarm goes off at 7 AM every morning.

**Not quite!** A simple alarm just follows a basic timer. It doesn't perceive anything new or make decisions. It's more like a mechanical clock.

However, if your alarm uses an app that tracks your sleep patterns and wakes you during light sleep for the best wake-up experience - **then yes, that's an AI agent!**

### Scenario 2: A Thermostat
**Situation**: A thermostat that turns on heating when the room gets cold.

**Basic thermostat: Not really** - It just follows a simple rule: "If temperature < 68Â°F, turn on heat."

**Smart thermostat (like Nest): YES!** - It learns your schedule, knows when you're home, and adjusts temperature proactively. It perceives (temperature, time, presence), thinks (predicts your needs), and acts (adjusts temperature).

### Scenario 3: Email Spam Filter
**Situation**: Your email automatically moves suspicious emails to spam.

**YES!** This is a great example of an AI agent:
- **Perceives**: Reads incoming emails and checks their content, sender, etc.
- **Thinks**: Decides if the email looks like spam based on patterns it learned
- **Acts**: Moves spam to the spam folder, or lets good emails through
- **Learns**: Gets better over time as you mark emails as spam or not spam

## Interactive Challenge: Design Your Own AI Agent

Now it's your turn! Think about a problem you'd like to solve, and design a simple AI agent to help.

### Step 1: Pick a Problem
Choose something from your daily life. Here are some ideas:
- Remembering to water plants
- Choosing what to wear based on weather
- Organizing your homework
- Picking a movie to watch
- Helping you wake up on time

**My problem is**: ________________________________

### Step 2: What Should It Perceive?
What information does your agent need to gather?

**My agent needs to know about**: ________________________________

### Step 3: How Should It Think?
What decisions does it need to make?

**My agent needs to decide**: ________________________________

### Step 4: What Should It Do?
What action should it take?

**My agent should**: ________________________________

## Example: Plant Watering Agent

Let's see a complete example:

**Problem**: I always forget to water my plants!

**Perceive**: 
- Check soil moisture with a sensor
- Check what type of plant it is
- Check the weather (if it's a outdoor plant)

**Think**:
- "Is the soil dry?"
- "When was the last time this plant was watered?"
- "Does this type of plant need water every day or once a week?"

**Act**:
- Send a notification to my phone: "Time to water the fern!"
- Or automatically turn on a water sprinkler for a set amount of time

**Learn** (bonus):
- Track which plants are thriving and adjust watering schedule
- Learn seasonal patterns (need less water in winter)

## Discussion Questions

Think about these questions, or discuss with a partner:

1. What's the difference between a simple computer program and an AI agent?
2. Can you think of three AI agents you've interacted with today?
3. Why is it useful for AI agents to learn and improve over time?
4. What's an AI agent you wish existed to make your life easier?
